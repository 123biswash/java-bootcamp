PROMPT user for number of classes taken, NoOfClasses
INITIALIZE counter to NoOfClasses

INITIALIZE GPA to 0

INITIALIZE TOTAL to 0 

WHILE (counter is not zero)

      PROMPT user for grade received in the given course number(out of 4.0), GRADE

      IF GRADE=='A' THEN gradePoint is equal to 4.0

      IF GRADE=='B' THEN gradePoint is equal to 3.0

      IF GRADE=='C' THEN gradePoint is equal to 2.0

      IF GRADE=='D' THEN gradePoint is equal to 1.0

      IF GRADE=='F' THEN gradePoint is equal to 0.0

      ADD gradePoint to TOTAL
END OF WHILE

GPA is equal to TOTAL DIVIDED by NoOfClasses

IF GPA is greater than or equal to 3.0 THEN PRINT "Congrats!"

ELSE PRINT "Aw..Fudgewickets!"
