Algorithm:

- Prompt user for radius of circle

- User inputs radius of circle, store it in radius

- Ensure the value is a positive number and if not, start prompting user from the beginning

- Multiply radius by radius and Pi, and store it in Area

- Display "The area of circle is", Area

 

Pseudocode:

Import math.pi

DECLARE radius

DECLARE area

DO WHILE input is not a positive number
       PROMPT user for radius of circle, store it in radius

END OF DOWHILE

MULTIPLY radius by radius and Pi, store it in area

DISPLAY "The area of circle is", area
